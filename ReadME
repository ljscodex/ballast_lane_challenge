The Solution is composed by 3 projects:
1) AuthAPI 
      This API manage the Login and Registration endpoints for users.

      To handle users and roles, this API was created using EFcore.
      This API supports dockerization.

2) CarsAPI
      This API controls all the Cars operations for the CRUD.
      Can be use with Docker just creating the Dockerfile.

3) CarsAPI.Test
      Here you will found a few unit testing cases using Xunit framework.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps to run the project:

1) Execute the dbCreation.sql Script
2) Excecute the sql_SP.sql script

These two files are necesary to manage the data of the CarsAPI project.

To consume all the private endpoints you have to run the AuthAPI project, so, here you have the steps to run it

1) If you did not execute all the SQL scripts from the CarsAPI Project, you have to.
2) Execute Database Update command to start the migrations scripts.
3) Before to Login, you must create an user with the CreateUser endpoint
   1) User Password must be Strong!.


If you wanna use Docker on the AuthAPI project you have to execute the following commands:

 docker build -t authapi .     
 docker run -d -p 5001:80 --name authapicontainer authapi

 

Both projects run with swagger documentation.
